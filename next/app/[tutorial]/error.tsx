 * Error Handling
 * https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling
 *
 * The error.js (.tsx) file convention allows you to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors in nested routes.
 *
 * error.js (.tsx) automatically creates a React Error Boundary that wraps a nested child segment or page.js component.
 * The React component exported from the error.js (.tsx) file is used as the fallback component.

/**
 * Catching rendering errors with an error boundary
 * https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary
 *
 * By default, if your application throws an error during rendering, React will remove its UI from the screen.
 * To prevent this, you can wrap a part of your UI into an error boundary. An error boundary is a special component
 * that lets you display some fallback UI instead of the part that crashedâ€”for example, an error message.
